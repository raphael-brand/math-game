testing

after solving (cases ordered by occurence probability):
    
- the **sum** of the remaining tiles is **greater** than the _number_
- remaining **sum** is **lower** than the _number_
- remaining tiles don't fit the number (too much and too high)
- numbers repeating (are the same than the last substracted number before solving)
